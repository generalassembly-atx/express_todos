# Express To-Do List

### More Express Practice!

Use Express to write a basic to-do list app. Most features are up to you, but you must be able to add new list items. Also, each GET request must use `res.render`. No more `res.send` responses!!

Run `express -e todo_app` inside your forked/cloned HW repository to begin.

### Required Routes

* GET `/items`: Displays all items
* GET `/items/new`: Render the form to add a new item
* POST `/items`: Submission of new item form

### Bonus Features

* Styling!
* UX flow – move the new items form onto the items index page
* Object-orientation
  * You'll want to make the constructor function in `item.js` in a `models` folder.
* Add images or GIFs to to-do list items
* Be creative!
